# üìà RSI Forecasting Project

Welcome to the UK RSI Forecasting Project! This repository contains my work on diagnostic analysis and developing predictive models and analysis for the Retail Sales Index (RSI) in the Uk based on external economic indicators (like Bank rate, Exchange Rate and GDP index)

---

## üìù Project Overview

This analysis was aimed to give a predictive model for UK Retail Sales Index (RSI) that would rely on historical data and economic indicators, by fulfilling three objectives- studying its correlation with economic indicators, forecasting using OLS and ARIMAX model.

- **Data Collection**: Gathering historical data of RSI and economic indicators from authentic sources (Bank of England, Office of National Statistics). 
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning, transforming, and manipulating data for analysis.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Implementing Pearsons Correlation coefficient and Null hypothesis testing.
- **Forecasting Models**: Using statistical and machine to predict future RSI values.
- **Visualization**: Building dashboards to display RSI trends and forecasts.
